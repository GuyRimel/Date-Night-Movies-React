Date Night Movies client
Description:
This is the client side for the "Date Night Movies" web app

Techstack (client side):
React,
HTML, CSS, JS
SCSS, JSX transpiled by Parcel

Basic Approach:
React renders the components described in 'index.jsx' into the root app-container in 'index.html'

Parcel will bundle/transpile my pitiful, human-written 'src' files into the final impeccable code-generated 'dist' files. Enter the Matrix, amirite?
